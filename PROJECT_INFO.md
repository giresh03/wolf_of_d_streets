## 🎮 How It Works

### Team Flow
1. Team visits website
2. Enters team name and capital
3. Watches stock market video
4. Notes stock prices
5. Enters quantity and buys/sells
6. Portfolio updates in real-time
7. Can see all transactions
8. Can see holdings and value

### Admin Flow
1. Admin visits /admin
2. Enters password
3. Sees live leaderboard
4. Clicks team to see details
5. Monitors all transactions
6. Can reset team if needed

## 🔧 Customization Guide

### Change Admin Password
File: `src/pages/AdminLogin.jsx` (line 9)

### Modify Colors
File: `tailwind.config.js` or individual components

### Add More Stock Videos
Already supported - just paste URL in input field

### Change Refresh Rate
File: `src/pages/AdminPanel.jsx` (line 20)
Change `5000` to your preferred interval (ms)

### Modify Capital Rules
File: `src/pages/TradingPage.jsx`
Find `handleBuy` and `handleSell` functions

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Demo Mode**: Stock prices are simulated (not real-time)
2. **Simple Auth**: Admin uses password (upgrade to Firebase Auth)
3. **No Trade History**: Can't see previous trades in detail view
4. **Single Stock**: All trades assume same stock (easily expandable)
