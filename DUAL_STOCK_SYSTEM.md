🟢 BUY - Stock 1        10 shares
@ ₹100 = ₹1,000

🔴 SELL - Stock 2       5 shares
@ ₹150 = ₹750
```

## 📊 **How It Works:**

### **Portfolio Value Calculation:**
```
Portfolio Value = Current Capital + (Stock1 Shares × Stock1 Price) + (Stock2 Shares × Stock2 Price)
```

### **Example Trading Scenario:**

**Initial State:**
- Capital: ₹10,000
- Stock 1 Shares: 0
- Stock 2 Shares: 0

**Action 1: Buy 50 Stock 1 @ ₹100**
```
Cost: 50 × ₹100 = ₹5,000
Capital: ₹10,000 - ₹5,000 = ₹5,000
Stock 1 Shares: 50
Portfolio Value: ₹5,000 + (50 × ₹100) + (0 × ₹150) = ₹10,000
```

**Action 2: Buy 20 Stock 2 @ ₹150**
```
Cost: 20 × ₹150 = ₹3,000
Capital: ₹5,000 - ₹3,000 = ₹2,000
Stock 2 Shares: 20
Portfolio Value: ₹2,000 + (50 × ₹100) + (20 × ₹150) = ₹10,000
```

**Action 3: Sell 25 Stock 1 @ ₹120** (price changed)
```
Revenue: 25 × ₹120 = ₹3,000
Capital: ₹2,000 + ₹3,000 = ₹5,000
Stock 1 Shares: 25
Portfolio Value: ₹5,000 + (25 × ₹120) + (20 × ₹150) = ₹11,000
```
✅ **Profit: ₹1,000 (10%)**
